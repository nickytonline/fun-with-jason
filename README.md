# Walkthrough Wednesdays with Jason Lengstorf: DEV API project using serverless

We talked Jamstack, serverless, and I got to have some fun and pair with Jason. We used Netlify's serverless functions to quickly set up an API to grab DEV posts with the DEV API, i.e. this repository. ðŸ˜Ž

Thanks again for coming on the stream Jason! ðŸ˜Ž
